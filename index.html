                <p class="about-me-words">
                I was born in Johannesburg, South Africa to a Dutch father and an English mother, who moved our family to the US and Atlanta when I was three.  I grew up in Atlanta through high school, where I graduated from the Westminster Schools.
                After high school, I went to Vanderbilt University for my undergraduate degree, where I majored in both applied mathematics and economics, with a minor in finance.
                Upon graduation, I moved to New York to work for a boutique management consulting firm named "Mars & Co", where I worked for the first two and a half years out of college. During this time I worked for Mars on 3 different continents, with projects taking me to Brussels, Sao Paolo, and across the US.
                After my 2.5 years in New York, I transferred to the San Francisco office, where I would go on to work largely with one of our largest clients, Mattel, on a massive supply chain optimization project, which involved me living between mainland China and Hong Kong for nearly half a year.
                I then moved on to work for Facebook and Atlassian as a compensation specialist, setting and applying market rates for employee compensation, as well as creating and managing the overall budget for equity spend within the companies.
                After all these experiences, I have now started to work on becoming a coder to apply my more analytical and systems driven thinking to my work more directly.
