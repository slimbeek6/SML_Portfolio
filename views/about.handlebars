                I'm Shaun, a full-stack web developer and recovering consultant.  I'm currently living in San Francisco, and studying at the University of Berkeley extension to earn my certificate in full-stack coding.
                <br><br>
                After earning a BS in Mathematics and Economics from Vanderbilt University, I began a career in management and strategy consulting at a boutique firm named Mars & Co. During this time I worked for Mars on 4 different continents, with projects taking me to Brussels, Sao Paolo, Hong Kong, Chang'anzhen, and across the US.
                <br><br>
                After five years on the road, I transitioned careers applying my modeling skills and business knowledge as a compensation analyst first for Facebook, then Atlassian. Since leaving Atlassian, I have started to learn and work with web development as a way to apply my analytical and systems based thinking.
