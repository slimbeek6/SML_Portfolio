# Shaun Limbeek's Portfolio

## Summary

The request was to create a set of three interconnected webpages to serve as a portfolio for my ongoing work with coding.  The three pages are an index, a portfolio page, and a contact page.  These pages link to each other, and are created to be responsive to different browser page sizes. The index page looks like this:
